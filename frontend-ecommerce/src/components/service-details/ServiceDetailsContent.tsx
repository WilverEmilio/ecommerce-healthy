                <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
                    praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
                    expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
                    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
                    itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
                    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
                    is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
                    because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
                    and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which
                    of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
                    advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to
                    enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
                    that produces no resultant pleasure</p>
